# Georgia-Hep-C-Project

Georgia is an Eastern European, middle-income country with 3.7 million residents. A 2002 survey in the capital city of Tbilisi found that 6.7% of the general population and 70.4% of persons who inject drugs had antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV), evidence of past or current HCV infection. These data suggest that HCV prevalence in Georgia could be among the highest globally. In 2015, Georgia launched the worldâ€™s first HCV elimination program, aiming to provide universal access to curative, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment and to implement nationwide prevention measures to curb ongoing transmission. 

The first nationwide population-based Hepatitis C survey was conducted in 2015 to provide baseline data for the Georgian HCV elimination program, launched in April, 2015. This analysis presents national HCV prevalence, risk factors and genotype distribution.
